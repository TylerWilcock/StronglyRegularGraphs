This repository contains the codebase for the Strongly Regular Graph solving algorithm.  This project began at the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater as an Undergraduate Research project under the guidance and assistance of Dr. Athula Gunawardena, Dr. Sobitha Samaranayake, and numerous other professors.  The goal of this algorithm is to generate an adjacency matrix for Strongly Regular Graphs, with the overall goal being the generation of a matrix for graphs that, as of now, are considered to be open problems.  Specifically, the target of this project is the smallest open case of Triangle Free Strongly Regular Graphs, (162, 21, 0, 3).

If this is something that interests you, you can <a href = "http://hansnet.flnet.org/learn-srgs">learn the basics of Strongly Regular Graphs here</a>.  <a href = "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StronglyRegularGraph.html">Wolfram Alpha</a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_regular_graph"> Wikipedia </a> are also good resources.  For those who are mathematically inclined, there a numerous research papers on the Internet that describe the intricate details of Strongly Regular Graphs.

<h2> Runnable Jar File </h2>

If you're interested in running the most current .jar file to see what the current implementation can do, you can get this project by using the <code> Clone in Desktop </code> or <code> Download ZIP </code> buttons on this page.  Additionally, the .jar file is available for download at DOWNLOAD_LINK.

<h2> I've downloaded the Jar File - Now What? </h2>

For any mobile users, as far as I know it's difficult to run a .jar file on a mobile device, so if you've downloaded the .jar on your mobile device it may be easier to switch over to your desktop computer.  If you are running on a desktop, here's how you can run the downloaded .jar file.
